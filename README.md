# Graduation_projects
# Bacterial Mutagenicity Project 
## Problem Statement 
The purpose of this project is to give the users with a forum where they can check the toxicity of the chemicals which would help them to identify the factors they need to take care before distributing the chemical to the user base. This would help to prevent possibility restricting cancer mutagen chemical to the environment.
 
## Steps
- Data Collection: Data was collected from the GENETOX_Bacterial mutagenicity_NTP data which is in chemical-in-rows format, comma-separated values. Data is available in three different tables, so merging happens according to the requirements. 
- Data Wrangling: The datasets were uploaded to a dataframe and explored. Null values were filled in wherever appropriate and polluted values were discarded or wrangled.
- EDA: Extensive data visualisation and summary statistics were used to extract insights and pattern from the various datasets. 
- Machine Learning: Logistic Regression and Mutinomial regression, Random Forest were trained on our feature engineered dataset to predict whether the combination of various chemicals leads to mutagenicity or not. 
- Visualizations: Various graphs are built using ggplot library in R language.

# Cost Estimation_Analysis_Regression_project

## The cost estimation model
This model will be used to estimate the average cost per finished block in an order.  It is based on the job characteristics that the customer specifies at the time the order is placed.
## The cost analysis model
This model will be used to understand the actual average cost per block of a completed job.  The model will be based on production data and should be useful for analyzing how various aspects of production affect costs.

## Learnings: 
- Selection of Variables for both the models 
- Transformations - Natural logarithmic transformation is done,
- Outlier Detection/ Detection of Influential Points
- Assumption Checking - QQ PLots, ,Residual Plots
- Building of Candidate Models

# DATA PIPELINE Using Python 

Given Three Database tables containing information about deals and investors. I have to generate following two outputs:
1) a list of deals with the investors (by name) who participated in that deal,
2) an adjacency matrix where a connection between two investors (by virtue of having participated in the same deal) is denoted as one connection (the underlying graph is undirected).
3) Constructed data pipeline code (preferably Python)
4) Error Checking is done.
5) Use of a MySQL database (and MySQL code).

# RENTAL_CAR Project

Given Two tables Vehicles and reservations and need to answer following Questions:- 
- Which of the factors seems to be most important in driving # total number of reservations for our vehicles. (Technology type, pricing,no. of car photos, street parking, car description length).
- How does the carâ€™s technology type seem to affect reservations?

- Used R language to do the analysis.

## STEPS:- 
- EDA- Exploratory Data analysis - Provide Insights from visualizations.
- Building Poisson Regression Models and selected best among them and answered the questions on basis of results. 
- Visualizations- Graphs are build using ggplot library in R.

# Sampling Project: 
- Application of Different Sampling Techniques on Chicken weight dataset.
- Simple Random Techniques, Stratified Random Sampling(Propotiona/Neymann Allocation), Ratio Estimation, Regression Estimation, Domain Estimation, Clustering.
